# eetvoorkeur

This is yet another side project in the series of [eetFestijn](https://github.com/joostrijneveld/eetFestijn) and [eetvoudig](https://github.com/joostrijneveld/eetvoudig). This project is the de facto prequel to the other two, enabling users to vote on the available options until the selection deadline is reached.

The main reason for spending a Sunday on this was to have a go at [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) (although I ended up yak shaving with bootstrap forms for a large part). This project is currently unfinished, insecure and completely unstable. _Do not use outside of localhost_.
